- update game
	- change bat's width
	- change bat's y position
	- reset bat's position when game restarts


- extract environment state data -> inputs: remaining lives, current score, current activated column
	(defined columns -> bat's width, the window's width)
	(current activated column -> ball's position)

-develop the q learning algorithm
	- define the state space
	- define the action space
	- define the q table
	- define number of episodes
	- define exploration rate decay
	- define learning rate
	- store the q table physically

- train the agent

- extract training data
